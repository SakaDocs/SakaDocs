## About SakaDocs 

This platform is built using MEAN.JS. It is a platform that makes it easy for people to find their lost documents

MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications.



## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Downloading MEAN.JS
There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate: 

### Yo Generator 
The recommended way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html) which will generate the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs
```
This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command:
```
$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip
```
Don't forget to rename **mean-master** after your project name.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop you MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:

```
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            
That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation. 
If you encounter any problem try the Troubleshooting section.


## Running in a secure environment
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following commnad: 
```
$ sh generate-ssl-certs.sh
```
Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority)
To generate the key and certificate and place them in the *config/sslcert* folder.

##Usage
The user will have an option of either searching for a document, or posting a document that he/she has found.Before doing any of the above, he/she will be required to login to his/her account and if they dont have one, they should create it.
If user searches for and finds a document, they will be required to top up their account via mpesa/visa/mastercard/paypal, and after confirming that, they will receive the mobile number of the user that posted the document and a code to pass to the finder. 
After they have called the finder, recovered their document and passed the code to them, their account balance will be deducted the amount payable for the document they have recovered, and the account of the finder will be credited with a share of the amount if the finder enters the code received from the document owner. Users will have an option of withdrawing their balance.
